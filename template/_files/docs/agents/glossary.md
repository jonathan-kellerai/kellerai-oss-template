# Glossary

Tier-2 detail for [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).
The load-bearing vocabulary for **{{REPO_NAME}}**.

This glossary is a fast index, not the authoritative definition source.
The authoritative definition for any term is the artifact file that introduces it.

## Artifact types

- **`{{ARTIFACT_TYPE}}`** — the artifact type this repository publishes.
  The primary validator is `{{PRIMARY_VALIDATOR}}`.
  The artifact lives under `{{ARTIFACT_DIR}}/`.

## Repository structure terms

- **Tier 1** — the lightweight agent entry point: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
  These files are a table of contents. For in-depth detail, follow the pointers to Tier 2.
- **Tier 2** — deep reference files under `docs/agents/`:
  `conventions.md`, `citation.md`, `glossary.md`, `enforcement.md`.
- **Publishable tree** — every file not matched by `.gitignore`.
  The boundary is the source of truth for what ships.
- **Staging file** — any file matched by `.gitignore`.
  Staging files may be edited directly, without a PR.

## Contribution terms

- **Conventional Commits** — the commit message convention enforced by `commitlint`.
  Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
  See [`conventions.md`](conventions.md).
- **Semver** — Semantic Versioning applied to the artifact.
  `major` = breaking; `minor` = additive; `patch` = editorial.

## Add terms here

As the artifact grows, add load-bearing vocabulary to this file.
Every change that introduces a new term MUST add a glossary entry in the same pull request.
